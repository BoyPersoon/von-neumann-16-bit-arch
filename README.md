# Von Neumann 16-bit architecture

This repository contains the hardware description for most circuits necessary to assemble a computer based on the Von Neumann architecture. 

The work present in this repository is being used as a basis to create the computer using electronics. The resources provided by the [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) course, directed by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, has served as a starting point for the current present implimentation.
